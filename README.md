This project is a clone of Twitter(now X) made with Flutter.

For backend communication, I have used [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/) as BAAS (Backend as a Service) to store data.

Used shorebird for realtime app updates.

Current features:
- Login
- Signup
- Profile
- Posts along with pictures
- Like and unlike posts
- Retweet
- Follow and unfollow users
- Notifications regarding like, retweet

Note :- All these features are only available for logged in users. 
        This app was built few months before Twitter was changed its name to X. 
        I built this app as my side project to learn Flutter.
